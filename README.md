  > You need a userscript manager like [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/#installation) to complete the installation.


- Browser must support [Baseline 2023](https://web.dev/baseline/2023) features.
  > **Browsers and their earliest version supporting [Baseline 2023](https://web.dev/baseline/2023):**

### Known Limitations
- Most common UI elements are covered, though some niche components may still need work. Contributions, issues, and suggestions are welcome.
- Some elements may briefly appear unstyled before the script injects the theme. This is a limitation of **Stylus Shadow DOM Support**.
- CSS improvements are ongoing. Portions of the theme will continue to be cleaned up and reorganized.
- Designed for Carleton but has partial compatibility for other institutions that also use D2L Brightspace.

### Mission Statement
This project aims to provide a cohesive, dark look across Brightspace. Unlike automatic dark-theme plugins, which often produce unappealing artifacts or unreadable elements, this theme offers a consistent style with additional clarity and contrast.
